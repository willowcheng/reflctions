When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To collaborate with my peers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To have logical commit and keep it readable.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork does clone other's repo and make it as my own in Github. Clone only copy all the code to local. Branches are different functional staff for different development purpose.
